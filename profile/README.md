# Barad Lab at OHSU
Welcome to the GitHub organization for software tools developed in the Barad Lab at Oregon Health & Science University

## Mission

Our goal is to develop tools to enable integrative structural and cellular biology using Cryo-ET and other technologies, and to share them freely to help the community better study biology across scales.

## Software Principles
1. Unless it is not possible because of dependencies, software will be licensed permissively
2. We are biologists first, and cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We hope that all of our software will eventually be polished, flexible, and easy to use, but we will not wait for those things to be true before sharing our tools as is! 
3. While this organization will host Barad lab specific tools, we encourage contribution to larger shared organizations, such as [teamtomo](https://github.com/teamtomo) when the scope of the project is appropriate

## Contributors
The Barad lab organization welcomes contributions from outside of the lab. We expect contributors to respect [our lab's collaboratively developed compact](baradlab.com/compact)
